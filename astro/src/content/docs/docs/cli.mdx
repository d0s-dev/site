## Installation

To install the CLI on a workstation with network access, run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://d0s.dev/install | sh
```

For air-gapped environments, download the installer bundle from the catalog and transfer it via removable media. Verify signatures with `cosign` before running the installer script.

## Bootstrap a Cluster

Once the CLI is installed, authenticate against the target kubeconfig and bootstrap the baseline stack:

```bash
d0s init --profile edge
```

This provisions the core platform services, applies security baselines, and prepares the cluster for catalog deployments.

## Next Steps

- Use `d0s catalog list` to inspect available secure application bundles.
- Apply a package with `d0s deploy <package>`.
- Visit the Headlamp UI at the route exposed during `d0s init` to monitor cluster health.
