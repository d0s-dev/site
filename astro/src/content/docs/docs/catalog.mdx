## Catalog Snapshot

The catalog exposes a curated collection of hardened application bundles. Each package ships with:

- Signed archives compatible with air-gapped transport.
- CVE metadata generated during nightly scans.

- Component provenance via SBOM exports.

The Astro `/catalog` route renders this data for at-a-glance awareness. During early development the grid is populated with representative mock data; a real API integration will land in Phase 2 when the GitHub source of truth is wired in.

## Verifying Packages

1. Download the desired tarball from the catalog or synchronize the git repository offline.
2. Verify the detached signature:

   ```bash
   cosign verify-blob --key cosign.pub --signature <package>.sig <package>.tar.zst
   ```

3. Inspect the SBOM (CycloneDX) and scan report before promoting to production.

## Deploying a Bundle

Once validated, deploy from the CLI:

```bash
d0s deploy ./packages/keycloak
```

The CLI automatically detects whether it is connected or running in a fully disconnected environment and adjusts the workflow accordingly.

## Next Steps

- Phase 2 will introduce live data hydration using GitHub APIs and ETag-aware caching.
- Watch `/catalog` for charting and advanced filtering once connected to production telemetry.
