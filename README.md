# d0s.dev - Official Website

The official website for **d0s** (Disconnected Operations System) - a powerful platform for deploying and managing applications in air-gapped and edge environments.

🌐 **Live Site:** [https://d0s.dev](https://d0s.dev)

## 🎨 Design

This site uses a custom Figma design built with **Astro**, **Starlight**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The design includes:

- **Landing Page** - Flashy hero with terminal animations and feature showcase
- **Documentation** - Starlight-powered documentation with search and theming
- **App Catalog** - Browse and deploy applications with live GitHub data
- **Interactive Features** - CVE charts, manifest overlays, and filtering

## 🚀 Local Development

- Node.js 20.x or higher
- npm 

### Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the Astro project:**
   ```bash
   cd astro/
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:4321`

### Available Scripts

All commands should be run from the `astro/` directory:

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production (includes docs sync and script bundling)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run check` - Run Astro diagnostics and TypeScript checks
- `npm run test` - Run unit tests with Vitest
- `npm run lint` - Check code formatting with Biome
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-format code with Biome

## 📦 Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Automatic Deployment

Every push to the `alpha-release` branch triggers an automatic deployment:

1. GitHub Actions builds the site using Astro (`astro build`)
2. Static files are generated in the `astro/dist/` directory
3. The site is deployed to GitHub Pages

### Manual Deployment

Deploy manually from the `astro/` directory:

```bash
npm run build && npx gh-pages -d dist
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### GitHub Pages Setup

To enable GitHub Pages for your repository:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**
2. Set **Source** to "GitHub Actions"
3. Save the configuration

### Custom Domain

To use a custom domain (like d0s.dev):

1. Add a `CNAME` file to the `astro/public/` directory with your domain
2. Configure DNS records:
   - Add an `A` record pointing to GitHub Pages IPs:
     - `185.199.108.153`
     - `185.199.109.153` 
     - `185.199.110.153`
     - `185.199.111.153`
   - Or add a `CNAME` record pointing to `d0s-dev.github.io`
3. Update the `site` configuration in `astro/astro.config.mjs` if needed
